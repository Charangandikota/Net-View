<h2>Appendix A. Topology Server Commands</h2>
<center><p>The topology server commands provided in this appendix are intended to be used
as reference material. Syntax diagrams are provided for each command.</p></center>
<hr style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black">
<h2>config</h2>
 <h2>Format</h2>
<h3>config</h3>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Use the config command to specify that the topology server processes are to be
started as daemons. Also use this command to specify the heartbeat interval for the
topology server.</p>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<h2>-d</h2><p>Specifies that the topology server processes be started as daemons. Updates are
made to the appropriate system files so processes start automatically when the
system is started.
    This operand can be used only on the AIX or Linux platform.</p>
<h3>-h xx</h3>
<p>Specifies the heartbeat interval for the topology server, where xx is the interval,
in minutes, for generating heartbeats, such that the topology server resource in
the topology display subsystem view remains in satisfactory status. The
minimum is 5 minutes; the default value is 60 minutes unless it is overridden
in the server.properties file.</p>
<h3>f xx.xx.xx.xx</h3>
<p>Specifies an additional address by which your system is known. This can be
used if you are using network address translation (NAT) and the topology
server is being accessed by this method.</p>
<p>The variable, xx.xx.xx.xx, is the TCP/IP address in dot notation</p>
 <h3>Note:</h3> <p>The server must be rebooted after issuing this command in order for it
to take effect.</p>
<hr style="border-width: 1px;border-color-black">
<h2>cpebatch</h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<h4>cpebatch</h4>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Starts the command profile editor batch utility. For additional information about
the command profile editor, see Chapter 11, “Using NetView Management Console
Command Profiles,” on page 93.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<h5>filename</h5>
<p>If the -O option is specified, this is the name of the output file that is created
by the utility. If the -I option is specified, this is the name of the input file that
    is read by the utility. This parameter is required with the –I option.</p>
<h2>-O</h2>
<p>Generates a response file from the current commands database. The filename
specifies the name of the file generated by the utility. If this is not a
fully-qualified name, the file is generated in the current directory. If no name is
specified, the default name of IHSECPED.RSP is used. The -O or -I parameter
must be specified.</p>
<h3>-I</h3>
<p>Specifies a response file to be used to update the current commands database.
Unless the filename is fully-qualified, it is assumed to reside in the current
directory. The -O or -I parameter must be specified.</p>
<h3>-u</h3> <h4>loginid</h4>
<p>If the user ID is not present in the command line, you are prompted to provide
this information. The user ID must match your NetView user ID.</p>
<p>The login user ID must have administrative authority.</p>
<h3>-p</h3><p>password</p>
<p>The password or password phrase for the login user ID that is specified by the
-U parameter. There is no default value. If a password or password phrase is
not in the command line, you are prompted to provide this information. This
password or password phrase must match your NetView password or
password phrase. If a value is not specified, the command profile editor utility
tries to sign on to the topology server with a null password. This is an optional
parameter.</p>
<i><b>-L1</b> log file</i>
<p>The name of the error log file to which you want to log informational and
error messages. The default is IHSECPED.LOG. If the file is not fully-qualified,
    it is put in the following directories:</p>
<ol>
<li>For Windows systems: %BINDIR%\TDS\server\log</li>
    <li>v For AIX or Linux systems: $BINDIR/TDS/server/log</li></ol>
<p>The error log file is continually appended, so that multiple runs of the utility
are logged in the same file.</p>
<p>This is an optional parameter</p>
<h3>-v</h3>
<p>Forces the utility into verify mode. The response file is processed and
compared with the data in the topology server, but no changes are made to the
actual topology server database. This is an optional parameter</p>
<h3>-M</h3>
<p>Overrides the default add mode of the utility and forces the utility into modify
mode. This enables information to be replaced in or deleted from the existing
database. This is an optional parameter.</p>
<h3>-G</h3>
<p>Overrides the default add mode of the utility and forces the utility into modify
mode. This enables updates to be made to command sets and profiles by
adding to them without replacing existing information. This is an optional
parameter.</p>
<h2>Return codes</h2>
<p>The command profile editor utility program generates the following return codes:</p>
<h3><b>RC</b>   Explanation</h3>
<p>0  Successful. The utility completed successfully. Unless -V was specified in
the cpebatch command, the database was updated.</p>
<p>4  Warning. The database was updated (unless -V specified) and warning
messages were logged.</p>
<p>8  Error. The database was not updated and error messages were logged.</p>
<p>12 Severe Error. The database was not updated and a severe error ended the
program immediately</p>
<hr style="border-width:2px; border-color: black">
<h2>dbtransfer</h2>
<h2>Format</h2>
<h3>dbtransfer</h3>
<p>►► tserver dbtransfer►◄</p>
<h3>purpose</h3>
<p>The<b> dbtransfer </b> command copies the topology server databases from the default
installation directories to the location defined by the <i>TSERVER_DB</i> variable. After
the <i>TSERVER_DB</i> variable is defined on the topology server workstation, this
utility must be run before the topology server is started. This command does not
change the contents of the topology server databases in the default installation
directories.</p>
<hr style="border-width: 1px;border-color:black">
<h2>getpd</h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<h4>getpd</h4>

command.</p>
<i><b>-d</b> NetView_domain_name</i>
<p>NetView domain name where you want to issue the command.</p>
<p> <b>-u</b>  Specifies the NetView operator ID where you want to issue the command. This
ID overrides any preset NetView operator ID (such as the ID that is set in the
ihsshstc.cfg file or the hostcmdoper command).</p>
<p>If the -u operand is specified without the -p operand, you are prompted to
enter the NetView password or password phrase.</p>
<p><b>-P</b>Specifies the NetView password or password phrase where you want to issue
the command. This password or password phrase overrides any preset
NetView password or password phrase (such as the password or password
phrase set in the ihsshstc.cfg file or hostcmdoper command).</p>
<p>If the -p operand is specified without the -u operand, you are prompted to
enter the NetView operator ID.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The default is to run the command on the NetView host where the NETCONV
session was initiated. See “Establishing Communication Between the NetView Host
and the Topology Server” on page 54 for more information about setting up a
NETCONV session.</p>
<p>The hostcmd command is issued from the command line or a script file. The
response to the hostcmd command is displayed in the same command window
you use to issue the command.</p>
<p>The hostcmd command is located in one of the following directories:
v For Windows systems: %BINDIR%\TDS\server\bin
v ForAIX or Linux systems: $BINDIR/TDS/server/bin</p>
<p>For AIX, Linux, or Windows systems, you can either change to this directory
before running the hostcmd command, or add the directory path to your PATH
environment variable</p>
<p>For more information about presetting the NetView operator ID and password or
password phrase, see “Defining the NetView for z/OS User ID and Password on
the Topology Server” on page 9.</p>
<p>If you want to route command responses to a file or log, or to automate actions
based on the command responses, you can customize the command exit source file,
ihsshstc.c, located in one of the following directories:
v For Windows systems: %BINDIR%\TDS\server\sample
v For AIX or Linux: $BINDIR/TDS/server/sample</p>

<h2>hostcmdoper</h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<h4>hostcmdoper</h4>
<h3>purpose</h3>
<p>Issue this command before issuing the hostcmd command to set the NetView
operator ID and password or password phrase. The hostcmdoper command can
also be used to display or delete the NetView operator ID and password or
password phrase in the ihsshiccc.cfg file</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>-u </b>Specifies the NetView operator ID where you want to issue a hostcmd
command.</p>

operand cannot be specified with any other operand.</p>
<p><b>-d </b>Deletes the ihsshiccc.cfg file, which stores the NetView operator ID and
password or password phrase. This operand cannot be specified with any
other operand.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>If the hostcmdoper command is never issued or if the -d option is run, and then
the hostcmd command is run, the hostcmd command either uses the operator ID
and password or password phrase that is stored in the ihsshstc.cfg file or prompts
the user for the operator ID and password or password phrase. The password or
password phrase is not encrypted in the ihsshstc.cfg file.</p>
<hr style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black">
<h2>ihszfmt</h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<h4>ihszfmt</h4>
<h3>purpose</h3>
<p>Formats the topology server error and trace logs. The output from the command is
directed to stdout. The error logs and trace files are located in one of the following
directories:</p>
<p>For Windows systems: %BINDIR%\TDS\server\log</p>
<p>For AIX or Linux systems: $BINDIR/TDS/server/log</p>
<h3>parameters</h3>
<h4>logFileName</h4>
<p>Specifies the topology server error log or trace file to format. To format the
error log, specify either ihserror.log or ihserror.bak. To format the trace log,
specify either ihstrace.log or ihstrace.bak.</p>
<p><b>-b </b>Specifies to suppress the formatting of the log in EBCDIC. This parameter does
not affect the formatting of the log in ASCII. Formatting of the log in EBCDIC
is important because the log contains data being sent between the topology
server and the NetView host; thus, do not suppress this formatting.</p>
<h3>outputFileName</h3>
<p>Specifies the file name for the formatted error log or trace file.</p>
<hr style="border-color: black">
<h2>ihszset</h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<h4>ihszset</h4>
<h3>purpose</h3>

<h2>Service</h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<h4>service</h4>
<p>►► service account_name password ►◄</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Sets up the topology server to run as a Windows service.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<h4>account_name</h4>
<p>If the service type is SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS, this name is the account
name in the form of ‘DomanName\Username’, which the service process logs on as
when it runs. If the account belongs to the built-in domain, ‘.Username’ can be
specified. Services of type SERVICE_WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS are not a valid
specification of an account other than LocalSystem. If NULL is specified, the
service logs on as the ‘LocalSystem’ account, in which case the password
parameter must be null.</p>
<p>If the service type is SERVICE_KERNAL_DRIVER or SERVICE_FILE_SYSTEM_DRIVER,
this name is the driver object name (that is, ‘\FileSystem\Rdr’ or
‘\Driver\Xns’), which the input and output (I/O) system uses to load the
device driver. If NULL is specified, the driver is run with a default object name
created by the I/O system, based on the service name.</p>
<h3>password</h3>
<p>Contains the password to the account name specified by the
IpServiceStartName parameter, if the service type is
SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS or SERVICE_WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS. If the pointer is
NULL or if it points to an empty string, the service has no password. If the
service type is SERVICE_KERNAL_DRIVER or SERVICE_FILE_SYSTEM_DRIVER, this
parameter is ignored.</p>
<h2>start</h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<h4>start</h4>
<h3>purpose</h3>
<p>Starts the topology server and communications server, then displays a topology
server window and a communications server window. If the topology server is
already running either in the background as a service or daemon or in a Windows
system, an additional instance of the topology server is not started.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>-d </b>Specifies that the topology server be run in debug mode. Additional
information is written to both the topology server window and to the topology
server message log.</p>
<p><b>-y </b>Generates the default topology server databases if no databases exist. Do not
use unless requested by IBM Software Support.</p>
<p><b>-b </b>Writes additional information to the message log when event data is received.
This is helpful if instrumentation is being developed, since it displays the data
received along with the information as it is processed.</p>
<p><b>-i </b>Runs the topology server in IP mode only. Communications through LU 6.2 is
not attempted.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>The server on a Linux for zSeries systems runs only in IP mode.</p>
<p><b>-p </b>portnumber</p>
<p>Specifies which port is to be used for communications with the topology
consoles. This does not override what is specified in the services file.</p>
<p><b>-s </b>Starts the server processes in the background for a AIX or Linux system. On a
Windows system, this starts the server processes as a Windows service,
assuming the server has been set up to run as a service.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>This parameter must be specified first.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The topology server and communications server windows only display messages.
Use the utility command to manually write the topology server databases to disk,
dump the server databases, dump the server semaphores, and so on.</p>
<hr style="border-color:black">
<h2>Stop</h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<h4>stop</h4>
<h3>purpose</h3>
<p>Stops the topology server processes.</p>
<h2>parameters</h2>
<p><b>-f </b>Use the force flag if one of the topology server processes ended abnormally or
if the topology server is hung. The force flag stops any remaining topology
server processes and then cleans up any remaining interprocess
communications (IPC) resources.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This is applicable only to the AIX or Linux platform.</p>
<hr style="border-color:black">
<h2>tcpipkey</h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<h4>tcpipkey</h4>
<h3>purpose</h3>
<p>Specifies the send and receive keys used for encrypting and decrypting data sent
or received by the workstation on the IP connection with the NetView host</p>
<h3>parameters</h3>
<p><b>-d </b> Resets the keys to their default values</p>
<p><b>-o </b>Sets the keys used for the NETCONV connection with the NetView host. Enter
the keys in the same format as they were entered in DSITCPRF. The first key is
used to encrypt data sent from the workstation to the NetView host. The
second key is used to decrypt data received by the workstation from the
NetView host.</p>
<p><b>xxsendxx</b>Used to encrypt data sent from the topology server to the NetView host</p>
<p><b>xxrecxx</b>Used to decrypt data received by the topology server</p>
<p><b>-v</b>Compares the two keys provided against the two NetView keys that are stored.
If the keys match, Yes is returned. If the keys do not match, No is returned. If
only one key is provided on the command line, both keys are prompted. If no
keys are provided, the user is prompted for both keys.</p>
<p><b>xxsendxx</b>Used to encrypt data sent from the topology server to the NetView host.</p>
<p><b>xxrecxx</b>Used to decrypt data received by the tropology server.</p>
<p><b>-? </b>Displays The Command Syntax.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>This command is used only for non-SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connections</p>.
<p>The keys for this command must be either eight or sixteen characters long. If a
sixteen-character key is entered, it is assumed to be a hexadecimal representation
of the key and it is compressed down to eight bytes. If only one key is provided
on the command line, then prompts are issued for both keys. If no keys are
provided, then the user is prompted for both keys. The keys are stored in an
    encrypted format in the following file:</p>
<p>For Windows systems: %BINDIR%\TDS\server\config\ihssckey.cfg</p>
<p>or AIX or Linux systems: $BINDIR/TDS/server/config/ihssckey.cfg</p>

<h1>Appendix C. Creating a Demonstration</h1>
<p>You can create your own new NetView management console demonstration,
customized to look and feel like your NetView management console environment
and display views from your network environment. This section provides the
process to create your own demonstration.</p>
<p>The demonstration capability is installed as part of the <i>NetView Management Console
Productivity Kit</i> (on the Windows platform, only). Be sure to perform a custom
installation of the NetView management console topology console and select the
<i>NetView Management Console Productivity Kit.</i> To access further information about
the demonstration function, in the Windows environment, double-click the NMC
Productivity Kit icon on the desktop.</p>
<p>You can capture views from a live NetView management console system and
integrate them into your demonstration. Do this to demonstrate NetView
management console in your own environment to provide operator training, for
example.</p>

<p>After you complete these steps, the new demonstration consists of the files that are
shown in Table 45.</p>

<hr style="border-color: black">
<h1>Capturing Live Views from your NetView Management Console System</h1>
<p>To capture views from a live NetView management console system for subsequent
integration into the demonstration, use the -saveViewsLocally command-line
argument. This argument instructs the Save View Customization code to save the
view in a local file in the installRoot \bin\generic_unix\TDS\client\views
directory instead of within the topology server database.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>For more information about local files, see “Renaming Navigation Views” on
page 136.</p>
<p>To capture a view from the client workstation and to save all the views that you
want to be displayed in your demonstration, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the command prompt, make a backup copy of the demonstration views
shipped with NetView management console in the following way:
    <p>a. cd installRoot \bin\generic_unix\TDS\client\views</p>
    <p>b. md backup</p>
    <p>c. copy * backup</p></li>
<li>From the command prompt, delete all of the shipped NetView management
console demonstration files in the following way:
<p>a. cd <installRoot>\bin\generic_unix\TDS\client\views</p>
<p>b. del *</p></li>
<li>Start the NetView management console topology console by using the
-saveViewsLocally command-line argument. To do this, change the propertiesof
the NMC Topology Console desktop icon, in the following way:
<p>a. Right-click on the NMC Topology Console desktop icon to display the
context menu</p>
<p>b. Click Properties.</p>
<p>c. From the notebook that opens, select the Shortcut tab.</p>
<p>d. Select the Target field and place the cursor after the last character.</p>
<p>e. Type a separating blank and then enter -saveViewsLocally</p>
<p>f. Click OK.</p></li>
<li>Start the NetView management console topology console and sign on.</li>
<li>Save the business tree view in the following way:
<p>a. Right click on the background of the business tree.</p>
<p>b. Select Save View Customization.
This creates the installRoot>\bin\generic_unix\TDS\client\views\1.ctl.md
file. The root node of the business tree is always resource ID 1.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>For more information about resource Ids, see “Finding the Resource
ID” on page 138</p>
<p>c. Save all of the specific views to be included in your demonstration by
opening each view individually. To open each view, perform one of the
    following actions:</p>
    <p>From the business tree, open each view sequentially.</p>
    <p>Select Locate Resource.</p>
<p>Select More Detail, Configuration, or Locate Failing Resource from an
open view.</p>
<p>d. To save each view:
1) Right click on the view background.
2) Select Save View Customization.</p>
<p>e. Correlate the type of view saved with the saved name by performing the
    following steps:</p>
<p>1 Write down information such as the view type, view name,
    Configuration Parents, More Detail, and Locate Resource.</p>
<p>2 Look in the installRoot \bin\generic_unix\TDS\client\views\
directory for the view that you just saved. It has the format.ctl.md. Write down this file name next to the view type.
You need this information when you rename the view to conform to the
demonstration naming conventions later.</p>
<p>The view you just created is the newest view in the directory. If you
kept track of the demonstration views as you created them, you should
be able to distinguish which view was just created to associate it with
the view type.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>Multiple navigation views can be created from the same resource.
A fixed file name is created for each view saved based on the ID of the
resource, regardless of how the view is opened. If you save a More
Detail and a Configuration view initiated from the same resource, the
same view file name is used. The last view saved is the available view.
If you want to have multiple navigation views available from a single
resource, you must use these steps:</p>
    <p>a) Select the Nth navigation view.</p>
    <p>b) Save the view.</p>
    <p>c) Rename the saved view.</p>
<p>d) Repeat these steps for the next navigation view.</p>
    <li>Integrate the captured views into the demonstration in the following way.</li>
<p>a. Update the business tree. For detailed information about performing this
    step, see “Updating the Business Tree” on page 134.</p>
<p>b. Rename the navigation views to conform to the required demonstration
naming conventions. For detailed information about performing this step,
    see “Renaming Navigation Views” on page 136.</p>
<li>Define any resource types in the saved views that were not previously defined.</li> </ol>
<h3>Using basic data files </h3>
<p>Because Resource Object Data Manager (RODM), the topology server, and the CPE
command definitions are not available when the NetView management console
topology console is run in demonstration mode, the basic data properties files are
used to define:</p>
<p> Resource types</p>
<p>Individual context menu items</p>
<p>Sets of context menu items</p> <p>A set of view menu items (resource independent)</p>
<p>A default set of real (resource dependent) resource menu items</p>
<p> A default set of aggregate (resource dependent) resource menu items
When the console starts, the following files are loaded from the
installRoot>\bin\generic_unix\TDS\client\settings directory:</p>
<p>basicdata[multicultural_support_language>] (base definitions of resources and
common menu items)</p>
<p>basicdata[multicultural_support_language>].nmc (additional NetView
 management console resource types and menu items) multicultural_support_languagemulticultural_support_languagemulticultural_support_language</p>
<p>Before making any changes to these files, make backup copies of these files with
one of the following methods:</p>
<p>Use a packaging tool such as PKZip, WinZip, or tar.</p>
<p>Create a backup directory and copy the installed files into it</p>
<p>The following Japanese files can also be customized, using double byte character
<p>set (DBCS) characters, with conversion commands:</p>
<p> basicdata_ja</p>
<p>basicdata_ja.nmc</p>
<p>defaultschemetext_ja.properties</p>
<p>To customize these files, first convert them with the following command prior to
editing:</p>
<p>native2ascii -reverse input_dir\filename outpug_dir\filename</p>
<p>After editing, perform a second conversion with the following command:
native2ascii -encoding SJIS input_dir\filename outpug_dir\filename</p>
<h2>Defining a Menu Item</h2>
<p>Table 46 gives a description of the attributes available for menu item definition
where the N in the attribute is a consecutive sequence number (1, 2, ..., n) within
the group of menu items. Several types of menu items are supported. Each type
has a separate definition list in the basic data file and different definition
requirements, as shown in Table 47.</p>
<center><img src="Screenshot%202024-01-24%20220810.png">
    <img src="Screenshot%202024-01-24%20223059.png"></center>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>1. These classes are part of the com.tivoli.ihs.client.action package.</p>
<p>2. This attribute,attr, is not currently implemented.</p>
<h2>Defining a Set of Menus</h2>
<p>A set of menus is a named group of one of the following items:
<p>Menu items</p>
<p>Separators</p>
<p>Other sets</p>
<p>A set can be used to define either of the following items:</p>
<p> A set of menu items that can be referenced as many times as needed</p>
 <p>A cascaded menu item</p>
<p>Conditional debug sets are enabled when the -debug command-line argument is
used.</p>
<p>A set is defined using the following syntax:</p>
<p>set.N.attr=value</p>
<p>set.N.X =tag reference</p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>The set stem uniquely identifies this as a set definition.</p>
<p>N is a consecutive sequence number (1, 2, ..., n) within the set definition area.</p>
<p>X is a consecutive sequence number (1, 2, ..., n) within a set.</p>
<p>The attributes in Table 48 can be specified for a set.</p>
<center><img src="Screenshot%202024-01-24%20224054.png">
<img src="Screenshot%202024-01-24%20224243.png">
<p>Each item of a set references one of the items in Table 49.</p>
    <img src="Screenshot%202024-01-24%20224505.png"></center>

    <p>set.5.3 =exCmdRsp</p>
    <p>set.5.4 =exIPL</p>
    <h2>Defining a Resource Type</h2>
    <p>A resource type is defined using syntax as shown in Table 50.</p>
    <p>Table 50. Attributes that can be specified for a resource type</p>
    <center><img src="Screenshot%202024-01-24%20231615.png"></center>
    <p>The following example is from the basicdata.nmc file:</p>
    <p>rt34_name=268828673</p>
    <p>rt34_desc=LU</p>
    <p>rt34_image=duiu5n00.gif</p>
    <p>rt34_geometric=com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsTrapezoid</p>
    <p>You can also specify additional context menu items for specific resource types. In
    the following example, each rtN_mi.X item is a tag reference.</p>
    <p>rt6_name=Lotus Notes Client</p>
    <p>rt6_image=notesc.gif</p>
    <p>rt6_geometric=com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsPentagon</p>
    <p>rt6_mi.1=-</p>
    <p>rt6_mi.2=start</p>
    <p>rt6_mi.3=stop</p>
    <p>rt6_mi.4=busSysHelp</p>
    <p>rt6_mi.5=instSmtpGW</p>
    <p>The current syntax for defining a resource type is available by using the following
command when CLASSPATH includes the ihseuc.jar file:</p>
<p>java com.tivoli.ihs.client.view.IhsResourceType</p>
<h2>Defining Defaults</h2>
    <p>Each basic data file defines defaults for the following items:</p>
    <p>View context menu items</p>
    <p>Common context menu items for each real resource</p>
    <p>Common context menu items for each aggregate resource</p>
    <p>These defaults are shown in the following example:</p>
    <p>###########################################################</p>
    <p># Default VIEW items</p>
    <p># - each SET reference is a "tag"</p>
    <p># - these values override those in "basicdata"</p>
    <p>###########################################################</p>
    <p>view.addDefault=true -- controls if defaultSet is added</p>
    <p>view.defaultSet=@nmcView -- set tag reference</p>
    <p>###########################################################></p>
    <p># Default Resource Type items for this "basic data" file</p>
    <p># - each SET reference is a "tag"</p>
    <p># - these values override those in "basicdata"</p>
    <p>############################################################</p>
    <p>agg.addDefault =true -- controls if defaultSet is added</p>
    <p>agg.defaultSet =@nmcAgg -- set tag reference</p>
    <p>real.addDefault=true -- controls if defaultSet is added</p>
    <p>real.defaultSet=@nmcReal -- set tag reference</p>
     <h3>Creating a New Resource Type</h3>
    <p>To create a new resource type, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Add the required rtN_xxx entries at the end of the appropriate basic data file.</li>
    <p><b>Note:</b> The sequence numbers, the N part of rtN, must be sequential with no
        intervening gaps.</p>
<li> To define the geometric shape displayed on a topology view, specify the
    appropriate package qualified class names as shown in the following list:</li>
<p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsCircle</p>
<p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsCircleStar</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsDiamond</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsHexagon</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsOctagon</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsOval</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsParallelogram</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsPentagon</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsRectangle</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsRoundRect</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsSolidLine</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsStar</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsTrapezoid</p>
    <p>com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsTriangle</p></ol>
<p><b>Example: </b>rtN_geometric=com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsHexagon</p>
<p>To use the new resource type in a view, set the anN_t attribute of a resource to the
rtN_name attribute of your new resource type. For example: an1_t=2147614793.</p>
<hr style="border-color: black">
<h2>Integrating Captured Views into the Demonstration</h2>
<p>To integrate the captured views into the demonstration, update the business tree
and rename the navigation views.</p>
<h2>Updating The Business Tree</h2>
<p>After the business tree has been saved, some work is required to make it usable by
the NetView management console code in demonstration mode. Note that the
original business tree file, shipped with NetView management console is the
avail.control.md.nmc file. It is located in the installRoot\bin\generic_unix\TDS\
client\views\backup directory you created before saving views. This file illustrates
the parent-child relationships used within the business tree to create the tree node,
branches, and leaf nodes.</p>
<p>To make the saved business tree available, perform the following steps from the
client workstation:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the command prompt, rename the saved business tree view in the
    following way:</li>
    <p>a. cd installRoot>\bin\generic_unix\TDS\client\views</p>
    <p>b. copy 1.ctl.md avail.control.md.nmc</p>
    <b>Notes:</b>
<p>a. The root node of the business tree is always resource ID 1. For more
detailed information about the resource ID, see “Finding the Resource ID”
    on page 138.</p>
<p>b. If you copy the file, instead of renaming it, you can keep the original if
    you want to restart the process during this procedure.</p>
    <li> Edit the avail.control.md.nmc file.</li>
<li>Replace the complete view model at the beginning of the file with the line in
the After column in Table 51. For more detailed information about the view
    model, see “Defining View Information” on page 140</li>
<center><img src="Screenshot%202024-01-25%20103240.png"></center>
<li>Remove all parent references to the root node of the tree by following these
    steps:</li>
    <p>a. Locate every parent reference by searching for the string _p=1.</p>
    <p>b. Delete each of these lines containing _p=1.</p>
    <p>c. Verify that the value is 1 (and not 1x or 1xx, for example).</p>
<li> Update the resource type for every node by inserting the RT prefix as shown
    in Table 52</li> 
    <center><img src="Screenshot%202024-01-25%20103721.png"></center>
    <li>Verify that the special business tree nodes shown in Table 53 on page 136 are
defined to use these specific resource type values. If a different value is
present as the anX_t attribute, replace it with the required value shown in
Table 53 on page 136.
By doing this, you can avoid error messages when NetView management
console is started and have the correct icon displayed in the business tree.</li>
<center><img src="Screenshot%202024-01-25%20103949.png"></center>
    <li>Remove the following attributes from every node in the business tree:</li>
    <p>anx_da=true</p>
    <p>anx_def=true</p>
<li> Save your changes.
    To verify these changes, perform the following steps:</li>
    <p>a. Start the NetView management console demonstration.</p>
    <p>b. Verify that the business tree is properly displayed.</p>
<p>c. Verify that the views you saved, which were initiated from the business
    tree, can open.</p>
<li> Integrate the captured views into the demonstration by renaming the
navigation views to conform to the naming conventions for your
    demonstration.</li>
<li> Define any resource types in the saved views that were not previously
defined.
</li>
    </ol>
<h2>Renaming Navigation Views</h2>
<p>To rename the navigation view, first locate the correct navigation file. All of the
target navigation files are located in the installRoot\bin\generic_unix\TDS\
client\views> directory. Table 54 shows the naming conventions.</p>
<center><img src="Screenshot%202024-01-25%20104458.png"></center>
<hr style="border-color:black">
<h2>Defining NewResource Types In Saved Views</h2>
<p>The views you save might contain resources that are not currently defined for the
demonstration. This section provides the steps necessary to define missing RODM
resource types to the demonstration. When a resource type is referenced in a view
that is not currently defined, messages similar to the following messages are
    written to stderr when the view is opened.</p>
<p>IhsViewModel:verifyView(save) Thread-8 p1=64 p2=ResourceType (2416050177) specified
    on 2 was not found</p>
<p>IhsViewModel:verifyView(save) Thread-8 p1=64 p2=Setting 2’s resource type to
    IhsNodeRT</p>
<p>IhsViewModel:verifyView(save) Thread-8 p1=1085 p2=ResourceType (2147549291)
    specified on 3 was not found</p>
<p>IhsViewModel:verifyView(save) Thread-8 p1=1085 p2=Setting 3’s resource type to
IhsLinkRT</p>
    <h4>where:</h4>
<p>2416050177 is the resource type specified in the anX_t attribute of a node
    resource.</p>
    <p>2 is the resource ID specified in the anX_r attribute of a node resource.</p>
    <p>2147549291 is the resource type specified in the alXt attribute of a link resource.</p>
    <p>3 is the resource ID specified in the alX_r attribute of a link resource.</p>
    <p>In a view, these resources display as icons.</p>
<p>All of the information required to define a RODM resource type is available from
the Legend window when you are connected to a live NetView management
console system. To define missing resource types referenced by saved views from
the client workstation, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select Help→Legend... to open the Legend window.</li>
<li> To locate the resource type, search the ID column of the Legend window for a
decimal value (2416050177, for example). This is the resource type that must be
    added.</li>
<li>Edit the basicdata.nmc file.
    For more information about this file, see “Using Basic Data Files” on page 129.</li>
<li>Using the information in Table 55, create a new resource type at the end of the
currently defined set.
<center><img src="Screenshot%202024-01-25%20105553.png"></center>
For more information about creating new resource types, see “Creating a New
Resource Type” on page 134.The following example shows how an Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking end
node can be defined:
    <p>rtX_name=327883</p>
    <p>rtX_desc=APPN end node (EN)</p>
    <p>rtX_image=duiu5n00.gif</p>
    <p>rtX_geometric=com.tivoli.ihs.reuse.gui.IhsOctagon</p></li>
    <li>Save your changes.</li>
<li>Start the NetView management console demonstration and verify that the
    proper icon is now displayed.</li></ol>
<hr style="border-color: black">
<h2>Finding The Resource Id</h2>
<p>The topology server assigns each resource an internal resource ID value. This value
is important for demonstration mode because it is used to generate the name of
navigation view files. To determine the ID of a resource on a live NetView
    management console system, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Sign on.</li>
<li>Select the Options menu item and then Console Properties to open the
    Console Properties notebook.</li>
    <li>Select the Service tab, which is the last tab in the notebook.</li>
    <li>Check Action in the Components section.</li>
    <li>Check Debug data in the Trace types section.</li>
    <li>Click OK.</li>
    <li>Select the view that contains the resource ID you want to find.</li>
<li>Click the resource to open the context menu for that resource and select
    Resource Properties.</li>
<li>Select the Debug tab. The Resource Properties window displays debugging
data about the resource.<li>
<li> Look for ibmId in the property field. The corresponding Value is the ID for
the resource. The ID value is displayed in decimal and hexadecimal. Usually,
    you need to use the decimal value.</li></ol>
<hr style="border-color: black">
<h2>Defining a Node Resource In a View</h2>

    <p>al15_1=28</p>
     <p>al15_2=9</p>

<h2>Defining a Demonstration View</h2> 
<p>A demonstration view is an ASCII flat file that is typically created as described in
“Capturing Live Views from your NetView Management Console System” on page
    127. It contains the following collection of object definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>A view model definition, as described in “Defining View Information” on page
    140.</li>
<li> Zero or more node definitions, as described in “Defining a Node Resource in a
    View” on page 138.</li>
    <li>Zero or more tack point definitions.</li>
    <li>Zero or more free text definitions.</li>
<li>Zero or more link definitions, as described in “Defining a Link Resource in a
    View” on page 139.</li></ol>
    <p>The following example shows how a demonstration view can be defined.</p>
